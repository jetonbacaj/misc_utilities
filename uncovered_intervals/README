One of our monitoring tools records how long various operations within a request take. A problem that we have is that sometimes parts are untimed. We'd like the parts which are not covered by the intervals so that we can fill them in.
Write a program that reads a list of possibly-overlapping intervals from STDIN, one per line, and outputs a list of the intervals  not  covered by the input intervals. For example, given input
2   6
9   12
8   9
18  21
4   7
10  11

your program should output

7   8
12  18

You may also assume that the input is well-formed (e.g. there are always two numbers per line, the second is always larger than the first).

(hint: you can do better than O(n2), where n is the number of input lines).
