Given a string of three different braces; `(`, `[`, `{`, and their corresponding closing braces `)`, `]`, `}`, solve whether the braces are "balanced".

For example, the string "{[()]}" is balanced, so this ought to yield a "YES" from the solver.  The string "{[[}]}" will yield a "NO".

See the `main` function how to pass the input.
