find the least common multiple for all integers [2,542]


Problem taken from `https://projecteuler.net/archives`, though the parameters were from [2,20] (sorry, I don't have the direct link to the problem handy).

The only reason why I stopped at 542 ... I didn't want to hardcode any more primes, and I was too lazy to pull relevant range of primes from the intertubes ;-)
