Given an n `x m matrix, find biggest connected structure (the nodes with 1s in them).  For example, given the matrix below;

-----------------
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
-----------------
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
-----------------
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
-----------------
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
-----------------

We can see two structures contiguous structures (the set of tuples);

{(2,1), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)}
and
{(3,3)}

If you want to see all of the connected structures, uncomment line 76 in the code.  To see only the biggest one, uncomment line 79 in the code.

Currently, the input matrix is hardcoded - it shouldn't be too hard to convert that to ask for input when the program is run... I'll leave that up to the masses. :-)

To run the program (you need Scala installed);

fsc ConnectedBlocks.scala
scala ConnectedBlocks
